Supervised segmentation of hyperspectral images using Python for pixel-wise classification based on spectral signatures.
# Supervised Hyperspectral Image Classification

This project focuses on **supervised segmentation of hyperspectral images** using Python. The main goal is to classify each pixel of a hyperspectral image based on its spectral signature.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn

## Approach
- Preprocessing of hyperspectral images
- Feature extraction for pixel-level classification
- Supervised machine learning algorithms for segmentation
- Evaluation of classification accuracy

## My Role
- Research and documentation of the project
- Analysis of results and summarizing findings

## Objective
- To demonstrate the ability to handle hyperspectral data
- Apply machine learning techniques for image classification
- Develop understanding of spectral image processing
